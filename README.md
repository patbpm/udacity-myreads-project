## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

## Deployment

`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favourite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.

## Description

This is my effort for the first project in the Udacity React Nanodegree.

It can be installed and started with the commands

`npm install`
  
`npm start`

The first screen shows 3 shelves of books. You can move books to another shelf by clicking the green icon beside the book and selecting the shelf name.

You can also click the checkbox of many books and select the shelf from the black "Move All" icon in the top right of the page to move many books at the same time.

You can search for books by clicking the purple "+" icon in the bottom right of the screen. It will take you to the search page. You can search for a book and the returned books will be displayed under the search bar. Click on the green icon to move it to one of your shelves. Use the back button in the search bar to return to the first page.

You can also click on the title of the book to be brought to the books individual page. Here you can see the description of the book.
